# WEBDEV

I added my three project which I completed in the web development course at my school.

NMayayleh_LIBRARY is a project for a library which the students can borrow any book they want. It is written in JS

NMayaleh_JS_AIRPLANE is a project for an airplane comapny which allows the users of the application to book a seat and get the details about the seat that they booked
Also, it is written in JS

NMayaleh_PHP_AIRPLANE is the same as NMayaleh_JS_AIRPLANE but the different is it is written in php
